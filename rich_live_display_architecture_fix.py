ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Revolutionary TUI Rich Live Display Bypass Issue

PROBLEM:
The Revolutionary TUI Interface is reaching enhanced fallback mode instead of 
Rich Live display path despite proper TTY detection and Rich availability.

ROOT CAUSE:
Exception thrown in Rich Live setup (lines 1124-1309) causes fallback to enhanced mode.
The exception is caught at line 1309 and triggers "Falling back to basic display".

SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE:
1. Add comprehensive exception logging to identify specific failure point
2. Fix the Rich Live context creation with more robust error handling  
3. Add fallback strategies within Rich Live setup before full fallback
4. Ensure alternate screen and terminal isolation work properly

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

Phase 1: Diagnostic Enhancement
- Add detailed exception logging in Rich Live try-catch block
- Log specific failure points (alternate screen, layout update, Live context)
- Capture full stack traces to identify exact failure location

Phase 2: Rich Live Setup Robustness  
- Make alternate screen setup more resilient 
- Add fallback strategies for terminal control failures
- Improve Rich Live context creation with better error handling

Phase 3: Graduated Fallback Strategy
- Try Rich Live with alternate screen
- If that fails, try Rich Live without alternate screen
- If that fails, try basic Rich panels without Live
- Only then fall back to enhanced fallback mode

Phase 4: Terminal Isolation Fixes
- Improve terminal controller integration
- Better handling of console._file operations  
- More robust screen buffer management
