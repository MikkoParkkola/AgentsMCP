## Detailed Findings

### üéØ Provider Selection Excellence

**Intelligent Multi-Factor Decision Making:**
The ModelSelector uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that weighs:
1. **Capability Match** (5.0 weight) - Task type alignment
2. **Cost Efficiency** (4.0 weight) - Budget optimization  
3. **Performance** (3.0 weight) - Quality requirements
4. **Context Length** (2.0 weight) - Input size requirements
5. **Provider Preference** (1.5 weight) - User preferences

**Example Selection Behavior:**
```
High-performance coding (no budget limit):
‚Üí Selected: premium-model (tier 5) 
‚Üí Reason: Performance tier match despite higher cost

Budget-conscious general use:
‚Üí Selected: free-model ($0.0/1k tokens)
‚Üí Reason: Cost efficiency optimization

Large context reasoning:
‚Üí Selected: premium-model (200K context)
‚Üí Reason: Context length requirement
```
