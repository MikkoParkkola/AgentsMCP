## Overview

AgentsMCP transforms software development by orchestrating specialized AI agents that work together as a coordinated development team. Each agent has specific expertise, decision rights, and responsibilities, enabling parallel development with proper coordination.

### Key Benefits for Development Teams

- **16 specialized roles** covering the complete development lifecycle
- **Parallel execution** of independent development tasks
- **Intelligent coordination** with automatic dependency management
- **Quality gates** enforced at every development phase
- **Validated performance** at scale with enterprise-ready capabilities

## Core Development Patterns

### 1. Sequential Development Pattern

Use this pattern for features with strong dependencies between phases:

```bash
# Phase 1: Analysis & Requirements
agentsmcp agent spawn business-analyst \
  "Analyze user feedback and define requirements for mobile notifications feature"

# Wait for completion, then Phase 2: Architecture
agentsmcp agent spawn architect \
  "Design notification service architecture with push notifications, webhooks, and retry logic"

# Phase 3: Implementation  
agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Implement notification service based on architectural design"

# Phase 4: Quality Assurance
agentsmcp agent spawn qa-engineer \
  "Test notification service end-to-end including failure scenarios"
```

### 2. Parallel Development Pattern

Use this pattern for features with well-defined interfaces:

```bash
# Start all roles simultaneously with clear interfaces
agentsmcp agent spawn business-analyst \
  "Define API requirements for user profile management" &

agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Implement user profile CRUD API with validation" &

agentsmcp agent spawn web-frontend-engineer \
  "Build profile editing UI components" &

agentsmcp agent spawn backend-qa-engineer \
  "Create comprehensive test suite for profile API" &

# Monitor all agents
agentsmcp agent list
```

### 3. Iterative Development Pattern  

Use this pattern for complex features requiring feedback loops:

```bash
# Iteration 1: MVP Implementation
agentsmcp workflow start iterative-development \
  --feature "user-dashboard" \
  --iteration 1 \
  --scope "basic-layout-and-navigation"

# Iteration 2: Enhanced functionality  
agentsmcp workflow start iterative-development \
  --feature "user-dashboard" \
  --iteration 2 \
  --scope "data-visualization-and-filtering"

# Iteration 3: Polish and optimization
agentsmcp workflow start iterative-development \
  --feature "user-dashboard" \
  --iteration 3 \
  --scope "performance-optimization-and-accessibility"
```
