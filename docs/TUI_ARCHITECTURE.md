# TUI Architecture - AgentsMCP Terminal User Interface

## Overview

The AgentsMCP Terminal User Interface (TUI) provides an interactive command-line interface for AI-powered development workflows. The current architecture (V3) implements a progressive enhancement approach with robust fallback capabilities.

## Architecture

### V3 Progressive Enhancement Design

The V3 TUI architecture follows a progressive enhancement strategy:

1. **Base Layer**: Plain CLI renderer (always available)
2. **Enhanced Layer**: Rich TUI renderer (when terminal supports it)
3. **Capability Detection**: Automatic terminal feature detection
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Seamless fallback to simpler renderers

### Key Components

#### Core Components
- **TUILauncher** (`src/agentsmcp/ui/v3/tui_launcher.py`): Main orchestrator and entry point
- **ChatEngine** (`src/agentsmcp/ui/v3/chat_engine.py`): Handles conversation logic and AI interactions
- **Terminal Capabilities**: Detects TTY, color support, and Rich compatibility

#### Rendering System
- **PlainCLIRenderer** (`src/agentsmcp/ui/v3/plain_cli_renderer.py`): Simple text-based interface (fallback)
- **RichTUIRenderer** (`src/agentsmcp/ui/v3/rich_tui_renderer.py`): Enhanced interface with panels and formatting
- **ConsoleRenderer** (`src/agentsmcp/ui/v3/console_renderer.py`): Console-style flow layout renderer

### Features

#### Terminal Compatibility
- **TTY Detection**: Automatically detects if running in a proper terminal
- **Color Support**: Checks for ANSI color capability
- **Rich Support**: Validates Rich library compatibility
- **Graceful Fallback**: Always provides a working interface regardless of terminal capabilities

#### User Experience
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better terminals get enhanced features
- **Consistent Commands**: Same command set across all renderers (`/help`, `/quit`, `/clear`)
- **Signal Handling**: Proper SIGINT/SIGTERM handling for graceful shutdown
- **Resource Management**: Clean startup and shutdown with proper async handling

#### Developer Features
- **Logging Suppression**: Clean output by suppressing debug/info messages during TUI mode
- **Async Integration**: Proper async/await patterns with event loop management
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation

## Usage

### Basic Commands
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/quit` - Exit the TUI
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- Any other input is treated as a message to the AI assistant

### Starting the TUI
```bash
agentsmcp tui
```

The TUI will automatically:
1. Detect terminal capabilities
2. Select the best available renderer
3. Initialize the chat engine
4. Start the interactive loop

## Development History

### V2 System (Removed)
The V2 "Revolutionary TUI" system was an experimental approach that attempted to implement complex layout management and real-time updates. It was removed due to:
- Layout calculation issues causing display corruption
- Header duplication problems
- Complex synchronization requirements
- Maintenance overhead

### V3 System (Current)
The V3 system was redesigned with simplicity and reliability as core principles:
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features when supported
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Work on any terminal, enhance on capable ones
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between rendering and logic
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Always provide a working interface

## Testing

The TUI system includes comprehensive validation through:
- End-to-end functionality tests
- Terminal compatibility validation
- Renderer selection verification
- Signal handling testing
- Resource cleanup validation

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Always provides a working interface
2. **Compatibility**: Works across different terminal environments
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new renderers or features
5. **Performance**: Minimal overhead in base configuration

## Future Considerations

- Additional renderer types for specialized terminals
- Enhanced keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- Plugin system for custom UI components
- Integration with external terminal multiplexers
