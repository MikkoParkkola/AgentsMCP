# Project Overview

This repository documents a "CLI-driven MCP agent system" with an **extensible retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline**, a **configurable runtime**, and a **multi-agent DevOps workflow**. The goal is to provide a reference implementation for building agents that interact through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Key capabilities:

- **CLI-first workflow** – interact with agents locally via the command line.
- **Extensible RAG** – plug in different data sources for context-aware responses.
- **Configurable runtime** – adapt transports, storage, and tools through configuration files.
- **Multi-agent DevOps** – support specialized agents for linting, testing, deployment, and other lifecycle tasks.

For foundational practices on running these projects, see [ai-agent-project-principles.md](ai-agent-project-principles.md).
