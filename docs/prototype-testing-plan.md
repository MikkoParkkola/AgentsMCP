# AgentsMCP Prototype & Testing Plan

## Prototyping Strategy

### Phase 1: Click-through Prototypes (Low-fidelity)
**Timeline**: Week 2-3 of each development phase
**Tools**: ASCII mockups, Figma click-through, terminal recordings

#### Natural Language Command Flow Prototype
```
Scenario: New user creates their first Python security agent

Flow Steps:
1. Welcome screen → "I'm new to CLI tools"
2. Setup wizard → Basic configuration  
3. Command input → "create a python security checker"
4. AI composer shows intent understanding
5. Command preview and confirmation
6. Execution with progress feedback
7. Success celebration and next steps

Testing Focus:
- Can users understand what's happening at each step?
- Are the transitions smooth and logical?
- Do error states feel supportive rather than frustrating?
```

#### Symphony Mode Prototype  
```
Scenario: DevOps engineer monitors 5 active agents

Flow Steps:
1. Enter symphony mode from main CLI
2. Agent grid displays current status
3. Harmony score calculation and display
4. Task flow visualization
5. Error detection and recovery workflow
6. Performance metrics and insights

Testing Focus:
- Is the multi-agent status immediately comprehensible?
- Does the harmony metaphor help or hinder understanding?
- Can users quickly identify and resolve issues?
```

### Phase 2: Interactive Prototypes (High-fidelity)
**Timeline**: Week 3-4 of each development phase  
**Tools**: Terminal-based prototype, React CLI components

#### Functional Command Composer
- Working natural language processing (limited vocabulary)
- Real-time command preview
- Basic error correction and learning
- Integration with existing AgentsMCP commands

#### Basic Symphony Dashboard
- Live agent status updates (simulated)
