# TUI LAYOUT CORRUPTION FIX - VERIFICATION REPORT

## Summary
This report validates the fix for Rich layout corruption when typing.

## Key Fix Applied
- **Root Cause**: Manual `self.live_display.refresh()` calls disrupted Rich layout structure
- **Solution**: Removed manual refresh calls, let Rich handle refreshes automatically
- **Result**: Layout remains stable during typing, no more corruption or overlapping text

## Technical Details
The `_sync_refresh_display()` method was updated to:
1. Update input panel content atomically
2. Remove manual `Live.refresh()` calls that caused corruption
3. Let Rich Live display handle refreshes automatically
