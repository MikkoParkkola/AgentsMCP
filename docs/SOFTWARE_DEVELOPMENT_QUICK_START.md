# AgentsMCP Software Development Quick Start

Get your development team started with AgentsMCP in 5 minutes. This guide provides the fastest path to productive multi-agent software development.

## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install AgentsMCP (1 minute)

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/MikkoParkkola/AgentsMCP.git
cd AgentsMCP
pip install -e ".[dev,rag]"

# Quick configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with at least one API key (see Step 2)
```

### Step 2: Configure API Keys (1 minute)

Add at least one agent provider to `.env`:

```bash
# Option 1: OpenAI/Codex (recommended for complex tasks)
AGENTSMCP_CODEX_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here

# Option 2: Anthropic Claude (best for large codebases)  
AGENTSMCP_CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-claude-key-here

# Option 3: Local Ollama (free, requires local setup)
AGENTSMCP_OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server (30 seconds)

```bash
# Start AgentsMCP server
agentsmcp server start --host localhost --port 8000

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Step 4: Spawn Your First Development Agent (1 minute)

```bash
# Start with a simple development task
agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Analyze the project structure and suggest improvements for code organization"

# Monitor progress
agentsmcp agent list
```

### Step 5: Try Multi-Agent Coordination (2 minutes)

```bash
# Launch a complete feature development team
agentsmcp agent spawn business-analyst \
  "Define requirements for user authentication with OAuth2 and 2FA" &

agentsmcp agent spawn architect \
  "Design authentication service architecture with security best practices" &

agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Implement authentication API with JWT tokens and refresh mechanism" &

agentsmcp agent spawn qa-engineer \
  "Create comprehensive test suite for authentication service" &

# Check team coordination
agentsmcp agent list --show-dependencies
```

## 🎯 First Development Tasks

### Task 1: Code Analysis and Improvement

Perfect for understanding how AgentsMCP agents analyze and improve code:

```bash
# Backend code analysis
agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Review the FastAPI application structure in src/ and suggest improvements for performance, security, and maintainability"

# Frontend code analysis (if you have frontend code)
agentsmcp agent spawn web-frontend-engineer \
  "Analyze React components and suggest improvements for reusability, performance, and accessibility"

# Security analysis
agentsmcp agent spawn qa-engineer \
  "Perform security audit of the application including dependency scanning, code analysis, and configuration review"
```

### Task 2: Feature Implementation

See how agents coordinate to implement a complete feature:

```bash
# Feature: API Documentation Generation
agentsmcp agent spawn business-analyst \
  "Define requirements for automated API documentation generation with interactive examples and developer onboarding"

# Wait for requirements, then continue with design
agentsmcp agent spawn architect \
  "Design documentation generation system based on requirements, including OpenAPI integration and automated updates"

# Implement the feature
agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer \
  "Implement automated OpenAPI documentation generation with interactive examples, based on the architectural design"

# Test the implementation
agentsmcp agent spawn qa-engineer \
  "Test documentation generation system including accuracy, performance, and integration with development workflow"
```

### Task 3: Development Process Improvement

Use agents to improve your development workflow:

```bash
# CI/CD improvements
agentsmcp agent spawn ci-cd-engineer \
  "Analyze current CI/CD pipeline and suggest improvements for faster builds, better testing, and automated deployment"

# Development tooling enhancement
agentsmcp agent spawn dev-tooling-engineer \
  "Review development tooling and suggest improvements for developer experience including linting, formatting, and automation"

# Testing strategy optimization
agentsmcp agent spawn chief-qa-engineer \
  "Analyze current testing approach and suggest comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and performance testing"
```

## 🚀 Scaling to Full Team Development

### Week 1: Individual Agent Adoption

**Day 1-2: Single Agent Tasks**
```bash
# Start with focused, single-agent tasks
agentsmcp agent spawn coder "Refactor user authentication middleware"
agentsmcp agent spawn qa-engineer "Add unit tests for payment processing"
```

**Day 3-4: Two-Agent Coordination**
```bash
# Practice two-agent coordination
agentsmcp agent spawn architect "Design user notification system" 
# Then spawn implementation after design is complete
agentsmcp agent spawn backend-engineer "Implement notification system based on architectural design"
```

**Day 5-7: Three-Agent Workflows**
```bash
# Build three-agent workflows
agentsmcp agent spawn business-analyst "Define dashboard requirements"
agentsmcp agent spawn web-frontend-engineer "Implement dashboard UI"  
agentsmcp agent spawn web-frontend-qa-engineer "Test dashboard across browsers"
```

### Week 2: Multi-Agent Team Coordination

**Complex Feature Development:**
```bash
# Full team for complex feature (5+ agents)
agentsmcp workflow start feature-development \
  --feature "real-time-collaboration" \
  --roles "business-analyst,architect,backend-engineer,web-frontend-engineer,backend-qa-engineer,web-frontend-qa-engineer,ci-cd-engineer" \
  --coordination-mode "parallel-with-sync-points"
```

**Parallel Development Streams:**
```bash
# Multiple features in parallel
agentsmcp team create team-alpha \
  --roles "architect,backend-engineer,backend-qa-engineer" \
