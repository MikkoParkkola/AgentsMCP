# Agent Architecture Best Practices

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. RAG Pipeline: Make It Optional
**Recommendation**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) should be **disabled by default** and only enabled when necessary.

**Rationale**:
- RAG data can quickly become stale, leading to incorrect or outdated responses
- Maintenance overhead of keeping embeddings fresh is often underestimated
- Direct tool use (file reading, API calls) often provides more accurate, real-time information
- RAG works best for static, well-curated knowledge bases that change infrequently

**When to use RAG**:
- Documentation that is versioned and immutable
- Historical data analysis where staleness is acceptable
- Large codebases where semantic search adds value
- When you have robust processes to refresh embeddings regularly

**When to avoid RAG**:
- Rapidly changing codebases
- Real-time system state queries
- Configuration or settings lookups
- When direct file/API access is available

### 2. Agent Coordination Patterns

**Two-Tier Architecture** (Recommended):
```
Tier 1: MainCoordinator (stateful orchestration)
Tier 2: Stateless Role Agents (pure functions)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and reason about
- Scales horizontally at Tier 2
- Single source of truth for state at Tier 1

### 3. Communication Patterns

**Structured Envelopes** over free-form messages:
- Use versioned envelope schemas (TaskEnvelopeV1, ResultEnvelopeV1)
- Include metadata for tracing and debugging
- Enforce contracts at boundaries
- Enable backward compatibility through versioning

### 4. Role Design Principles

**Single Responsibility**:
- Each role should have one clear purpose
- Avoid "super roles" that do everything
- Compose complex tasks through orchestration

**Stateless Execution**:
- Roles should be pure functions: input â†’ output
- State management belongs in the coordinator
- This enables parallel execution and retries

**Clear Decision Rights**:
- Each role should declare what it can decide autonomously
- Escalation paths should be explicit
- Quality gates should be well-defined

### 5. Testing Strategy

**Golden Tests** for contract validation:
- Define expected inputs/outputs for each role
- Use these as regression tests
- Enable test-driven role development

**Integration Tests** for workflows:
- Test multi-role interactions
- Verify orchestration logic
- Ensure error handling works end-to-end

### 6. Configuration Management

**Layered Configuration**:
```yaml
# Default configuration (built into code)
defaults:
  rag:
    enabled: false  # Safe default
    
# Environment configuration
environment:
  rag:
    enabled: true  # Override for specific env
    
# Runtime configuration
runtime:
  rag:
    refresh_interval: 3600  # Dynamic tuning
```

**Principle of Least Privilege**:
- Agents should only have access to tools they need
- Configuration should explicitly grant capabilities
- Default to restrictive permissions

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Avoid Premature Optimization**:
- Start with simple, correct implementation
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements over micro-optimizations

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache at the coordinator level, not in roles
- Use TTL-based invalidation
- Monitor cache hit rates

**Parallel Execution**:
- Identify independent tasks
- Use async/await patterns
- Implement proper backpressure controls

### 8. Error Handling

**Fail Fast**:
- Validate inputs early
- Return clear error messages
- Don't hide failures

**Retry Logic**:
- Implement at the coordinator level
- Use exponential backoff
- Set maximum retry limits

**Circuit Breakers**:
- Prevent cascade failures
- Implement health checks
- Provide fallback mechanisms

### 9. Observability

**Structured Logging**:
- Include correlation IDs
- Log at appropriate levels
- Make logs searchable and actionable

**Metrics**:
- Task completion rates
- Role performance metrics
- Resource utilization

**Tracing**:
- Implement distributed tracing
- Track task flow through roles
- Measure end-to-end latency

### 10. Security Considerations

**Input Validation**:
- Never trust external input
- Sanitize all data
- Enforce schema validation

**Secrets Management**:
- Never log sensitive data
- Use environment variables or secret stores
- Rotate credentials regularly

**Audit Trail**:
- Log all significant actions
- Include who, what, when, where
- Make logs tamper-evident

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **RAG-First Architecture**: Don't default to RAG; use it only when necessary
2. **Monolithic Agents**: Avoid creating agents that do too much
3. **Stateful Roles**: Keep roles pure and stateless
4. **Tight Coupling**: Avoid direct role-to-role communication
5. **Silent Failures**: Always surface errors appropriately
6. **Configuration Sprawl**: Keep configuration minimal and well-documented
7. **Premature Abstraction**: Don't over-engineer before understanding the problem
8. **Missing Observability**: Always include logging, metrics, and tracing from the start
