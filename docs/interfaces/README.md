# Developer Interfaces

Concise interface specifications to enable parallel implementation across modules. These are stable contracts (subject to minor adjustments) and should be adhered to by contributors.

- providers.md: Model discovery adapters and shared types
- chat.md: Chat command handlers and session runtime
- api-keys.md: Provider key validation, prompting, persistence
- mcp-versioning.md: MCP gateway version negotiation and tool schema down-conversion
- context.md: Deterministic context window trimming
- streaming.md: Streaming response interfaces
- build.md: Single-file binary build script inputs/outputs
- delegation.md: Delegation spec (command + MCP workflows)

Refer to docs/work-plan.md for task priorities and acceptance criteria.
