# Product Details

This repository documents a CLI-driven MCP agent system with an **extensible retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline**, a **configurable runtime**, and a **multi-agent DevOps workflow**. It serves as a reference implementation for building agents that interact through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## Architecture Overview
- **CLI-first interface** for invoking agents.
- **Extensible RAG layer** to plug in various data sources for context.
- **Configurable runtime** to adapt transports, storage, and tools via configuration files.
- **Multi-agent workflow** enabling specialized agents for linting, testing, deployment, and other lifecycle tasks.

## Initial Backlog
- Scaffold CLI commands for agent orchestration.
- Implement a minimal RAG module with pluggable data sources.
- Provide configuration examples for transports and tool access.
- Demonstrate a multi-agent CI pipeline.
