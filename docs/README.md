# AgentsMCP Documentation Index

This folder is the canonical source of truth for the project. We follow a single‑source policy and keep only a small set of essential documents.

Essential docs
- `backlog.md` — Prioritized, bite‑sized tasks with acceptance criteria. The only place for product improvements, fixes, and enhancements.
- `changelog.md` — Notable changes.
- `decision-log.md` — Decisions with outcomes and rationale.
- `installation.md`, `usage.md`, `configuration.md`, `cli-client.md` — How to install and use.
- `AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Architecture overview.
- `interfaces/README.md` — ICD policy and entrypoint.
- `models.md` — Providers and model guidance.

How to use
- Start with `backlog.md`. If you find contradictions, update the canonical file and reference it from older material (or remove the latter).
- After landing changes, update `changelog.md` and, if applicable, add a decision to `decision-log.md`.
