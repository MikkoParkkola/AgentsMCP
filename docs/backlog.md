**User Story**: As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and track all system activities.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Core Requirements**:
  - Given system activities, When they occur, Then detailed, tamper-proof logs created
  - Given compliance reporting, When requested, Then required audit information available and exportable
  - Given data retention, When policies applied, Then secure deletion or archival after retention period
  - Given audit search, When investigating incidents, Then efficient query capabilities with relevant details
  - Given compliance standards, When audited, Then SOC2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA requirements satisfied

- **Architecture Requirements**:
  - Immutable audit log storage with cryptographic integrity verification
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs and contextual metadata
  - Query optimization for efficient audit trail searches
  - Compliance reporting automation with templated outputs

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Immutable audit log storage with tamper detection
  - Structured logging (JSON) with correlation IDs
  - Authentication, authorization, and data access logging
  - Log integrity verification (HMAC) with secure key management
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance with data classification and retention

- **DevOps Requirements**:
  - Log Management: Centralized logging (ELK/Loki), structured logging, retention policies
  - Audit Trail: Immutable audit logs, compliance reporting automation
  - Log Security: Encrypted log transmission, log integrity verification
  - Compliance: GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA compliance controls, automated compliance checks

- **QA Requirements**:
  - Audit Testing: Comprehensive activity logging verification with tamper-proof validation
  - Compliance Testing: SOC2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA requirements automated verification
  - Performance Testing: Logging overhead <50ms per operation
  - Test Coverage: ≥95% coverage on audit and compliance modules

**Files**: `src/agentsmcp/audit.py`, `src/agentsmcp/compliance.py`, logging integration  
**Business Value**: **High** - Enables enterprise sales; regulatory compliance; reduces legal risk

#### ENT-002: Performance Monitoring & Alerting
**Story Points**: 13 (↑ from 8) **Priority**: P2-Medium
**User Story**: As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting so that I can proactively manage system health and prevent issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **Core Requirements**:
  - Given system metrics, When thresholds exceeded, Then appropriate alerts triggered via configured channels
  - Given performance trends, When analyzed, Then predictive insights and recommendations provided
  - Given incident response, When issues occur, Then diagnostic information immediately accessible
  - Given SLA monitoring, When tracking uptime/performance, Then automated reporting against targets
  - Given capacity planning, When analyzing usage, Then growth projections and scaling recommendations available

- **Architecture Requirements**:
  - Multi-dimensional metrics collection with configurable retention
  - Alert correlation and noise reduction with intelligent grouping
  - Performance baseline establishment with anomaly detection
  - Capacity planning automation with predictive modeling

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Security metrics dashboard (failed auth, suspicious activity)
  - Real-time alerts for security events with threat correlation
  - Performance budgets with security overhead tracking
  - No sensitive data in metrics/traces with data classification

- **DevOps Requirements**:
  - Observability Stack: Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing
  - SLI/SLO Definition: Service level objectives, error budgets, performance baselines
  - Alerting: Multi-channel alerting (PagerDuty, Slack), escalation policies
  - Incident Response: Runbooks, automated remediation, post-incident reviews

- **QA Requirements**:
  - Alerting Testing: Threshold-based alert accuracy and timeliness
  - Monitoring Testing: Metrics collection accuracy and completeness
  - Performance Testing: Monitoring overhead <5% of system resources
  - Test Coverage: ≥85% coverage on monitoring and alerting logic

**Files**: `src/agentsmcp/monitoring.py`, `src/agentsmcp/alerts.py`, performance tracking  
**Business Value**: **Medium** - Reduces downtime; improves performance; enables proactive operations
