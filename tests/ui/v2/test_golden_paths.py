"""
Golden Path Tests for TUI Input Fixes - Critical System Architect Requirements.

This test suite implements the golden tests defined by the system architect:
1. "Characters appear immediately when typed" (CRITICAL)
2. "Ctrl+C and /quit commands work reliably" (CRITICAL)
3. "No competing handlers conflict" (CRITICAL)
4. "Terminal state restored after exit" (CRITICAL)

These are the minimum required tests that MUST pass for the TUI to be considered functional.
Any failure in these tests blocks the system from being deployed.
