## Integration with CI/CD

The test suite is designed to integrate with continuous integration systems:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Development Workflow Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-development-workflows:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest-xdist pytest-timeout pytest-cov
      
      - name: Run development workflow tests
        run: |
          python tests/run_development_workflow_tests.py --suite integration --coverage --timeout 600
      
      - name: Upload coverage reports
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        if: always()
```

## Extending the Test Suite

### Adding New Test Scenarios

1. Create test functions in appropriate test files
2. Use proper pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, etc.)
3. Leverage existing fixtures for project structures and agent mocks
4. Follow naming convention: `test_<functionality>_<scenario>`

### Adding New Development Tools

1. Create mock tool classes in `test_development_tool_integration.py`
2. Add tool integration tests for agent workflows
3. Test tool loading and performance characteristics
4. Validate error handling for tool failures

### Adding Performance Tests

1. Add tests to `test_development_performance_scenarios.py`
2. Use `@pytest.mark.slow` marker
3. Include performance assertions and benchmarks
4. Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU, I/O)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout with `--timeout` option
2. **Memory Issues**: Run with fewer parallel processes
3. **Mock Failures**: Verify agent mock implementations match expected interfaces
4. **Fixture Errors**: Check project structure fixtures are created correctly

### Debug Options

```bash
# Verbose output with full tracebacks
python tests/run_development_workflow_tests.py --pattern "failing_test" -vvv --tb=long

# Run single test file
python -m pytest tests/test_software_development_workflows.py::test_specific_function -v

# Debug with pdb
python -m pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function --pdb
```

This comprehensive test suite ensures AgentsMCP can effectively support real software development teams with reliable multi-agent coordination, comprehensive tool integration, and excellent performance characteristics.
