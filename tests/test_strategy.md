# Multi-Turn Tool Execution Test Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy to ensure multi-turn tool execution functionality remains intact during refactoring.

## Core Functionality to Protect
1. **Multi-turn tool execution loop** - LLM executes multiple tools across conversations turns
2. **Tool results integration** - Tool outputs are properly added to conversation history
3. **Final analysis generation** - After max tool turns, LLM provides comprehensive analysis without tools
4. **Enable/disable tools mechanism** - Tools can be conditionally enabled/disabled in LLM calls
5. **Conversation history management** - Messages are properly tracked with timestamps
6. **Provider abstraction** - Works across different LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)

## Test Layers

### Layer 1: Unit Tests
- **LLMClient methods**: Test individual methods in isolation
- **Tool execution**: Mock tool calls and verify execution logic
- **Message preparation**: Test conversation history formatting
- **Provider selection**: Test fallback logic and provider switching
- **Response parsing**: Test tool call extraction and content extraction

### Layer 2: Integration Tests
- **End-to-end workflows**: Complete user queries with real tool execution
- **Provider integration**: Test with actual LLM providers (using test keys/local models)
- **Tool registry**: Test with real tools and verify results
- **Error handling**: Test failure scenarios and recovery

### Layer 3: Behavioral Tests
- **Multi-turn scenarios**: Test specific conversation patterns
- **Analysis quality**: Verify final analysis contains expected elements
- **Context preservation**: Ensure conversation context is maintained across turns
- **Edge cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Layer 4: Regression Tests
- **Golden master tests**: Capture expected outputs for known inputs
- **Performance benchmarks**: Ensure refactoring doesn't degrade performance
- **API compatibility**: Verify public interfaces remain stable

## Test Execution Strategy
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run critical tests before every commit
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Full test suite on PR creation and merges
- **Nightly builds**: Extended test suite with real provider integration
- **Manual testing**: Smoke tests for major refactoring milestones

## Success Criteria
✅ All tests pass before and after refactoring
✅ Test coverage > 90% for core multi-turn logic
✅ Tests run in < 30 seconds for fast feedback
✅ Easy to understand and maintain test suite
✅ Clear failure messages with actionable guidance
