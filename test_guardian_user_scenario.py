"""
Test script that simulates the exact user scenario that was failing with the 0.08 second shutdown.

This script demonstrates:
1. The original problem (Guardian with stale operations)
2. The fix (Guardian state reset with grace period)  
3. Verification that TUI now stays active properly

Run this script to verify the Guardian state reset fix works for the real user scenario.
