# Agent Instructions

Welcome! This repository contains resources for building a CLI-driven MCP agent system.

The full project overview, including goals and architecture, is available in [docs/project-overview.md](docs/project-overview.md). Start there for context before making changes.
Guidelines for human and AI agent collaboration based on the Business Rules of Acquisition are in [docs/broa-agent-guidelines.md](docs/broa-agent-guidelines.md).
An engineering handbook with principles and practices for AI-augmented software teams is available in [docs/engineering-handbook.md](docs/engineering-handbook.md).


## Conventions

- Use clear, concise commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Document any new behaviors or configuration options.
- Keep the codebase small and modular to support multiple cooperating agents.

## Additional Guidelines

- [broa.md](broa.md) – Business Rules of Acquisition for broader wisdom on collaboration and business.
- [docs/engineering-handbook.md](docs/engineering-handbook.md) – Playbook for humans and AI agents collaborating on software delivery.

## Operational Logs
