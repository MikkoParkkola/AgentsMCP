# Agent Instructions

Welcome! This repository contains resources for building a CLI-driven MCP agent system.

The full project overview, including goals and architecture, is available in [docs/project-overview.md](docs/project-overview.md). Start there for context before making changes.

## Conventions

- Use clear, concise commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Document any new behaviors or configuration options.
- Keep the codebase small and modular to support multiple cooperating agents.
