This document describes the implementation of the comprehensive agent role system in AgentsMCP, integrating specialist agents with MCP tool recommendations and long-term memory capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Agent Schema (`agent_description_schema.json`)

- **Memory specialization**: Added memory_specialization field for pieces tool integration
- **Interaction patterns**: Added interactions field for stakeholder mapping

#### 2. Memory Manager (`memory_manager.py`)
- **AgentMemoryManager**: Manages long-term memory using pieces tool integration
- **Memory categories**: Decision, learning, context, interaction memories
- **Contextual retrieval**: Semantic memory retrieval based on task context

## MCP Tool Integration

### Tier 1: Essential Cognitive Tools
- **pieces**: Long-term memory and context management (used by all agents)
- **serena**: Semantic code analysis (used by technical agents)
- **sequential-thinking**: Complex problem-solving (used by strategic agents)
- **git**: Version control operations (used by engineering agents)

### Tier 2: Quality & Security
- **semgrep**: Security analysis (used by security-engineer)
- **trivy**: Vulnerability scanning (used by security-engineer)
- **eslint**: Code quality enforcement (used by frontend engineers)
- **lsp-ts/lsp-py**: Language server protocol integration (used by architects)

### Tier 3: Research & Intelligence
- **web_search**: Market research and competitive intelligence (used by strategic roles)

## Key Features

### 1. On-Demand Agent Spawning
```python
agent_id = await orchestrator.spawn_specialist_agent(
    agent_type="security-engineer",
    task_context="Security review for authentication system"
)
```

### 2. Memory-Enhanced Delegation
```python
response = await orchestrator.delegate_to_specialist(
    agent_type="principal-software-architect",
    task="Design scalable microservices architecture",
    context={"requirements": [...]}
)
```

### 3. Contextual Memory Retrieval
```python
memories = await memory_manager.get_contextual_memories(
    task_description="API security review",
    agent_type="security-engineer",
    limit=5
)
```

### 4. Agent Recommendations
```python
recommendations = await orchestrator.get_agent_recommendations(
    task_description="Design user onboarding flow with security considerations",
    current_agents=["product-manager"]
)
# Returns: ["ux-ui-designer", "security-engineer"]
```

## Memory Architecture

### Hierarchical Memory Structure
- **Individual Agent Memory**: Role-specific expertise and experience
- **Task Context Memory**: Contextual information for current tasks
- **Interaction Memory**: Cross-agent communication and collaboration history
- **Learning Memory**: Insights and improvements from past experiences

### Memory Categories
- **initialization**: Agent spawning and setup context
- **decision**: Key decisions and their rationale
- **learning**: Insights gained from task execution
- **context**: Situational and environmental information
- **interaction**: Communication with other agents and stakeholders

### Memory Sync Patterns
- **Real-time**: Critical decisions and urgent context updates
- **Contextual**: Task-relevant memories injected during delegation
- **Periodic**: Regular cleanup and importance scoring updates
