# QWEN AGENT GUIDELINES

Use Qwen-family models for multilingual tasks, summarization, or when cost is a constraint.

Guidance:
- Keep prompts concise; specify output formats.
- For code, request explicit language versions and style guides.
- For translations, include tone, audience, and domain terminology.

Safeguards:
- Avoid speculative fixes without tests or reproduction.
- Flag ambiguous requirements and propose clarifying questions.
