"""Test script to verify the infinite loop fix for sequential thinking system.

This script tests that:
1. Sequential thinking calls have proper timeout protection
2. LLM client coroutine issues are resolved  
3. System can proceed with execution even when sequential thinking times out
4. No more infinite loops at "Phase 1: Sequential thinking and planning..."
