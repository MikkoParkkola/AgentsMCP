# Business Rules of Acquisition

*Copyright © Towo Toivola and Jukka Talvio 2006–2012*

The BRoA is a collection of time-enduring wisdom about business, humans, and life. You need to deeply understand the message of each rule, going beyond the obvious written message. Good advice to inspire good ideas. That also means that some people will use it exactly the other way; twisting teachings out of proportion and context until they justify the way they were thinking in the first place.

So be it.

You may ignore any rule at your own peril.
