# AgentsMCP Project Overview

## Purpose
AgentsMCP is a production-ready multi-agent development platform that orchestrates specialized AI agents for complete software development workflows. It supports 16 development roles from business analysis to ML engineering with validated performance at scale.

## Key Features
- **Multi-agent coordination**: Orchestrates specialized AI agents across development lifecycle
- **Revolutionary TUI Interface**: Rich terminal interface with 60fps animations, panels, and visual effects
- **Agent ecosystem**: 16 specialized development roles (business analyst, architect, engineers, QA, etc.)
- **Tool integration**: Comprehensive tool ecosystem (Git, shell commands, code analysis, web research)
- **Performance validated**: >5 tasks/second, 87% test coverage, <50MB memory growth
- **Multiple interfaces**: CLI, REST API, web UI, and interactive TUI

## Architecture
- **Multi-agent coordination** with parallel execution
- **MCP Protocol integration** with 60+ available MCP servers
- **Rich TUI system** with unified architecture to eliminate console pollution
- **Scalable backends**: Memory, Redis, PostgreSQL storage options
- **Security-first**: CodeQL, Semgrep, dependency scanning, secret detection

## Current Focus
The project has recently implemented a Revolutionary TUI Interface with sophisticated components:
- Rich multi-panel layout with status bars and interactive sections
- AI Command Composer integration with smart suggestions
- Symphony Dashboard with live metrics
- Advanced input handling with command completion
- Zero console pollution using unified architecture components
