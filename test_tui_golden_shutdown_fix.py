Golden Test: TUI Shutdown Fix Verification

This is a golden test that captures the exact issue that was fixed and demonstrates
that the solution works correctly. It mirrors the original problem scenario:

ORIGINAL ISSUE:
- TUI was shutting down automatically in 0.6 seconds
- "Guardian shutdown" warnings appeared prematurely
- User had no time to interact with the TUI
- Finally block was running cleanup even when not requested

THE FIX:
- Added _shutdown_requested flag to control when cleanup occurs
- Modified _wait_for_tui_completion to properly wait for user input
- Ensured Guardian only shuts down when explicitly requested
- Fixed finally block to respect the _shutdown_requested flag

This golden test verifies the fix works by:
1. Starting the TUI exactly as the user would
2. Confirming it doesn't shutdown in 0.6 seconds
3. Verifying it waits for user input
4. Testing clean exit when user decides to quit
